        <h2>üìú My Story</h2>
        <p>
          Through part-time jobs, weekend gigs, personal projects, and months of
          studying, I was able to obtain my Front-End certification through
          CodeX Academy. I learned that with enough self-discipline, effort, and
          time anything is possible.

          <a href="https://student-accounter.web.app">React Project</a><br />
          This is a React website I developed that keeps track of students and
          the number of tardies they have accumulated. It is stored in a
          Database and can perform all CRUD oporations. It also showcases a
          Login page with many other authentication features as well.

          <a href="https://extreme-hangman.herokuapp.com/">Javascript Project</a
          ><br />
          For this project, I practiced Javascript logic and how it connects to
          the UI. It is a simple Hangman game that features buttons with letters
          that turn blue or red depending on a correct guess. Try to guess from
          a large array of intense words!

            >HTML Project</a
          ><br />
          This HTML website has it all. I used complex CSS grids and reusable
          code with SASS to create diverse web pages. Using Javascrpt I added a
          stopwatch feature and a picture that makes an api call and displays on
          the front page. Other features include a form page, responsive
          breakpoints and a wheel that spins.
